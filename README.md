Temperature Measurement System Using PIC18F45K22 Microcontroller
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a temperature measurement system using the PIC18F45K22 microcontroller. The system measures temperature by varying voltage levels through a potentiometer, converts the analog voltage to a digital value using the ADC module of the microcontroller, and displays the corresponding temperature on a USART interface. Visual feedback is provided using LED indicators: a red LED for high temperature and a green LED for low temperature.


Features:
Microcontroller: PIC18F45K22
Analog Input: Potentiometer for temperature simulation
ADC Module: Converts analog voltage to digital value for temperature measurement
USART Communication: Sends temperature data to Tera Term for display
LED Indicators: Visual feedback for high (red) and low (green) temperatures
Pushbutton: Initiates temperature measurement process


Key Technologies Used:
Microcontroller Programming (PIC18F45K22)
Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC)
USART Communication
LED Indicators for Feedback


Setup:
Input Devices: Potentiometer (analog input) and Pushbutton (digital input)
Output Devices: Red and Green LEDs for temperature status, Tera Term for displaying temperature readings
Power Supply: Standard 5V supply


Results:
Temperature Display: Accurate temperature readings were displayed on Tera Term based on the potentiometer's voltage variations.
LED Indicators: Red LED lights up for high temperatures, while the green LED lights up for low temperatures.
